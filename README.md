## What's it all about?

This project takes a look at the state of remote work from 2019-2023. The data comes from a software
company called Buffer. They surveyed several thousand remote/hybrid workers and asked them various 
questions about who they are, what positions are they in, the types of work they perform and the
like. I'm going to combine and clean the data so I can make appealing visualizations of it with a Tableau
Public Dashboard.
