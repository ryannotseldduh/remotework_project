## What's it all about?

This project takes a look at the state of remote work from 2019-2023. The data came from Buffer and takes survey data from
several thousand remote workers and asks them various questions about who they are, what positions are they in, the types of
work they perform and the like. I'm going to clean and combine the data so I can make appealing visualizations of the data 
with a Tableau Dashboard.
