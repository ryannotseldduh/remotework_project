I think probably how rapidly tools have shot up to make remote work easier; I remember using Skype for all our company communications, pre-Slack, pre-Zoom... working remotely today is so much smoother and easier and it's only been 5/6 years...","Just that I really appreciate how Buffer presents a balanced view of what remote work is like. There's a fierce kind of ""remote work is freedom and if you don't travel and run a business you're not living right"" mentality among a lot of digital nomads that I find incredibly frustrating. This approach to work isn't for everyone, it's not always easy, and it's important to show a balanced view of what can be a practically and emotionally challenging lifestyle choice. It means a lot to see a company like Buffer being open about the realities of what it's like, while remaining optimistic, curious, and striving for improvement.

Now I'm not a slave to work, it's a compliment to my life. :)","I know so much that remote work is for me, that I do sometimes fear that if something happened and I wasn't able to work this way anymore, how I would handle that. It's not imminent, so there's not too much anxiety there, but I know that if it did become imminent, I would be panicking a bit. When you're meant for remote work, I think you just cherish it so much that you can't imagine not having it one day.

A question I might add here for next time is something that gets to if someone has ever moved from remote work to a conventional work set-up. I think that would be really interesting to hear about!"
