When you work in an office, there's constant implicit feedback about what you do and how well you perform. When you work remotely, most of the times you'll just have silence when everything works well. Can be very tough to have an idea of your daily performance, and a bit stressful.

Gets better after 1 or 2 years","Remote work success is mostly about company culture. Working remotely one day a week in a company that relies a lot (often implicitly) on RL communication doesn't work well, because there's important communication channels that you won't have access to when you're home. You miss decisions, casual discussions etc. 

Building a remote-friendly company means that everything is written down, and communication is mostly async. Even for casual conversations. 

You can keep an office with non-remote people, but you got to ack that they will live in a different universe than the remotees, which will create different, possibly conflicting cultures

And as remote working is still wildly viewed as a privilege, these cultural differences can easily lead to clanification/conflicts"

It's been really hard to answer this survey (Even though you did a great job of writing it). I work for myself, sort of. I work as an employee of a company, sort of. They let me work remotely pretty much all year. And now i'm here in Bali and working for them, instead of as a freelancer. But freelancing on the side doing writing still. I don't pay for coworking spaces because the company I work for IS a coworking space. But I worked from home this summer in NYC and would go to cafes sometimes. I guess, when you factor in the digital nomad traveling component to remote work, there's a whole bunch of other factors to consider too.","I don't think so. Maybe details around WHAT people are actually doing remotely. What skills they bring to the table.

My personal humblebrag is that at the last company I worked at, a major media company (Top 5 app download on all platforms + TV), the VP allowed only me to work from home FT. She had to battle her boss, the EVP, who did not believe in it. In the end, I was the highest performer in the organization and received the highest rating and an out of policy raise. I'm now an individual contributor. Earlier in my career, for many years, I was a manager and then leader of fairly large organizations. I always believed in allowing my talented and motivated people to produce in a way that made sense for them. My mantra was, ""You do it your way as long as you succeed, and then you do it my way."" Only twice, in hundreds of staff who worked for me, did I ever have to take control and change the work arrangement. I chalk that up to hiring well and setting clear expectations and holding people accountable. Where they work is irrelevant."

CEOs are more than happy to work ""on the road"" but they still expect their employees to be co-located in a place where a manager can easily look over their shoulder to make sure they're working. Look at Google/Twitter/Facebook/Apple - they're all firmly opposed to remote working. Small startups only seem to be on board with the idea out of their own financial interests (because they don't have to pay for office space), but as soon as they grow, they want to have an office where they can look out over their employees and tell future investors ""look at all the people we have working for us!"" It's such a myth that remote working is trending or is really becoming the way of the future. IT'S NOT. We're so so SO far away from that as a reality.","I hope we do find ourselves in a place where remote work is the future (and the rule, not the exception) but we're not there yet. The downside to these ""reports"" is that they're so misleading. People read them (and local newscasts report them!) as being the new shiny thing in the workplace. The reality is much much different. Who's the first to get laid off? It's the remote teams. Who gets paid less because ""you work from home"" (pay no nevermind to the fact that we have to cover so many of our own costs AND we're more productive). It's the remote employees getting shafted, bypassed for promotions - hindering their careers in exchange for being more productive and better communicators! Please include THAT in your report."
