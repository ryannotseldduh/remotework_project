I found that the most unexpected part. The biggest challenge was setting solid boundaries on email and chat response times (there was an expectation of immediacy which is super unproductive!) and meetings (so many team mates that don't plan expected others who did to rearrange schedules to accomodate drop in meetings and changes).

You also might find it useful to ask those who are remote due to covid policy if they will go back to office full time, mixed, or stay remote post covid.
Interesting note, in my workplace 1 day WFH was default due to office space issues with other flexible arrangements on application, covid forcing the company to go 100% remote for many months was an eye opener for all, flexible/remote working is going to be fully delegated to team level after this is all over, and has or will become a employer differentiator (esp in the conservative, regulated industry I work in), but this is all also dependent on workplace culture and tech stack.
Good luck with your survey!"

If its not promoted from top down(senior mgmt)its unlikely to work or be taken seriously. I have seen and felt this myself where its a set and forget mentality and nobody reaches out to you hence the lonliness. That feeling of annoying someone can be too easily portrayed or used as an excuse when you need or want to reach out to someone. Also the too busy excuse is a big one that i found is used alot. Again culture from top down and setting expectations around remote working are so important. Nobody needs to feel like they are a burden while working remotely.

In reality, this means hiring exclusively in states with bad labor laws and forcing anyone who lives near their HQ to come into the office, even when it's not needed. This created a toxic environment where city-based HQ employees were prioritised over remote workers, and it was sad to see. I moved to a company that was less vocal about its support for remote work, but which has been far more committed and inclusive than my previous employer. It has been really positive to see how a small company who doesn't necessarily see itself as a promoter of remote work has genuinely committed to making it work. I am encouraged by my experience, but still feel that companies who have been forced into remote work due to Covid likely need more education and support for how to improve processes and make remote-first successful when some employees return to the office. Making hybrid systems work can be very tough, as I saw in my last org."

Employees just need to submit bills and reimbursement is done on the next Salary date. We were one of the first tech companies in India to announce mandatory WFH for all our employees till the end of the year 2020. We made this announcement on May 6th, which was actually two days before Twitter made a similar announcement.  We run employee pulse surveys every two months and take such decisions on the basis of the feedback shared by employees in these surveys. Since announcing WFH for the rest of 2020, we've got overwhelmingly positive reviews for the WFH approach and that's why we are now a remote-first company.

Covid is a real problem at the moment, however. We wanted departments to meet up in person every two months. It's currently not possible with travel restrictions. Also, can we please set up a sort of EU lobby to facilitate cross border hiring without having to set up subsidiaries? It's possible in the UK and Germany but not in many countries.
